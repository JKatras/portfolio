EatIn Web Application

EatIn is a recipe-searching web application that seeks to be optimized for mobile use.  Users can browse recipes via Yummly's API based on keywords, ingredients to include, and ingredients not to include.  

User registration is not currently supported but seeks to be in the near future.

While Yummly's API does not allow procedural directions for meal preparation, external links are available to users.
